I'm a forth-year undergraudate student from [Xinya College](https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). In addition, I am also minoring in Economics and Finance at [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research interests are focused on computer vision, computer graphics and generative models. I also hope to expand my research boundaries, for example, into the intersection of AI and other disciplines.
